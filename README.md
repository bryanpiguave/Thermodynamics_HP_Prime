This repository contains the **Thermodynamics HP Prime App**, a powerful tool designed to solve various thermodynamic problems directly on the HP Prime Calculator. This app is ideal for students, engineers, and professionals who need to perform complex thermodynamic calculations efficiently.

## Features

The Thermodynamics HP Prime App includes:

- **Equations of State**: Solve various equations of state, crucial for understanding properties of gases and liquids under different conditions.
- **Compressibility Factor (Z)**: Calculate the compressibility factor for real gases, which is essential in refining ideal gas approximations.
- **Psychrometrics**: Access important psychrometric calculations related to air and moisture properties.
- **Basic Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE)**: Simplify phase equilibrium calculations between vapor and liquid phases, useful for chemical engineering applications.

## Installation

1. Download the `Thermodynamics.hpappdir` folder from this repository.
2. Connect your HP Prime calculator to your computer.
3. Copy the `Thermodynamics.hpappdir` folder to the `Applications` directory on your HP Prime.
4. Safely disconnect your HP Prime calculator.

## Usage

1. Launch the **Thermodynamics** app from the Applications menu on your HP Prime.
2. Select the module or calculation you need:
   - **Equations of State**: Choose from available models.
   - **Compressibility Factor (Z)**: Input required parameters.
   - **Psychrometrics**: Access air and moisture properties.
   - **VLE**: Perform phase equilibrium calculations.
